          ### Eyes


          Though they look simple, some jellyfish have surprisingly elaborate eyes with lenses. And they also use a protein that forms the basis of other animal visual systems. With molecular tools, phylogenetics, and experimental approaches, we can investigate how visual proteins and eyes evolved in these organisms.

          ### Symbiosis


          Corals and their photosynthetic symbionts are fundamental builders of reef ecosystems. To understand how these symbiotic systems evolved, we need to gain a better understanding of the relationship between symbionts and their host corals.

          ### Cnidocytes


          One of the most fascinating novelties of cnidarians are their stinging cells. These cells are unique to the group, but they can be incredibly diverse. They produce the cnidocysts and not only serve as models for studying origins of new cell types, but also inform us about cnidarian evolutionary relationships.
